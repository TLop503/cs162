Which function are you going to make virtual?
the constructor needs to be virtual so each derived class can implement it's own version as needed.

How will you make it polymorphic?
handling child classes as fruits as opposed to themselves will let them be used polymorphically

Can it be a pure virtual function?
it can be, though this might add work for simple fruits that need unique traits but not a unique constructor.

Which class have you made an abstract base class?
fruit, and to a lesser extent apple

Do any of the destructors need to be virtual? If so, which one(s)?
each parent class destructor needs to be virtual, as objects will be references via pointers.


-------------------


yes, you need to dellocate the fruits.

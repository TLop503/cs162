I used valgrind to find the issue was coming from the attempt to
 populate an array with no allocated memory.
I backtracked and found that the array was being set
 to a new var instead of the garage's array. 
Then, the populate function was being called on the car array, and
 not the cars in the array, so I added [i] and removed the 
 unneccessary pointer.

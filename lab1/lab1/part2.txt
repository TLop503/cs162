ex1:

take list x and int n
declare i, t, j = n
s = 1 (true), 

while s == 1 (true):
s = 0 (false)
do j times (n times)
if x[i] less than previous index
    swap 2 items in list
    then s = 1 (repeat proccess)
    decrease j, to stop checking end of list, as it is the known highest value

otherwise do nothing.

This is a basic sorting alg

Main prints a list, then sorts, then prints sorted list

---------------------

ex2:
take 2 numbers num, ctr and 1 PBR number r

for i = 2, i <= half of num (rounded down), i++
if num modulo i has no remainder
    increase counter and break out of for

if counter is 0 and num was not 1
    return 1 via PBR

else return 0

Checks if number is prime by checking all possible factors

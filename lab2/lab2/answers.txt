    1. yes, as long as you pass in a
    reference and use the dereference operator
    when using the paramater within the function

    2. to change the value use the dereference
    operator:
        *s = "stuff"

    3. & refers to the memory address of the target
    while *var = &x creates a pointer to that
    memory address

    Diagram:
        let x be var with memory address 0x10, ptr be pointer

        ptr = &x ----->  *ptr == contents of 0x10
        &x == 0x10 ----> &x++ == 0x11
